GLFW: create an OpenGL context to render in
GLAD: to look up where OpenGL functions locate at
Core Profile : a small core subset of OpenGL features
Register the callback functions after we've created
the window and before the game loop is initiated

glfwPollEvnet: check if any events are triggered

glfwSwapBuffers: will color buffer that has been used to draw
in during this iteration and show it as output to the screen
alpha stage: calculate opacity of the object
after fragment stage, object go through test stage including
z test, alpha test,blending test.

VBO(vertex buffer objects): high speed memory of GPU desinged to hold information about vertices

VBO has type of GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, bind VBO to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER by glfBindBuffer

glBufferData is a function specifically targeted to copy user-defined data into the currently bound buffer.

shader program: used for rendering. linked version of multiple shaders combined
all compiled shaders have to be linked to a shader program object
